                            products in the health and wellness marketplace. While our editors believe in every single product we feature on
                            our website, in the interests of transparency we would like to disclose some basic facts relating to some
                            products listed on our website which receive praise and positive reviews.</p>
                        <p>Here at Supplement Informer, we employ a comprehensive system of evaluation which carefully studies and measures
                            the quality and effectiveness of the products we review. We examine product ingredient quality, safety,
                            projected effectiveness, customer service policies, and overall customer satisfaction across a wide range of
                            different products and services.</p>
                        <p>We also spend time collecting information from relevant clinical studies and trials. We call our method
