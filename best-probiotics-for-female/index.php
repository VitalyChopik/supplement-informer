            <p class="comn-para">Vaginal infections represent a unique health challenge for women affecting not merely physical health but also emotional and social well-being of women. 
            </p>

            <p class="comn-para">Discomforting symptoms such as vaginal itchiness, irritation, swelling, soreness, discomfort, redness and vaginal discharge leading to frequent hospital visits, the estimated annual global economic burden of the treatment of vaginal infections costs the NHS £4.8 billion</p>

            <p class="comn-para">Vaginal yeast infections are especially common during pregnancy due to higher estrogen levels and glycogen content in vaginal secretions </p>
            
            <p class="comn-para">The disruption of vaginal ecosystem contributes to the overgrowth of pathogens which causes complicated vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). </p>

            <p class="comn-para">Research suggests that probiotics may be a useful tool in the treatment of vaginal and urinary infections as long as the right strains of probiotic are included in the supplement. However when looking under the hood of many of the market leaders in the space some of them did not include a single probiotic strain which was relevant to vaginal health.

            <h2 class="comn-hdng">Which strains of Probiotic are Key to Urinary and Vaginal Health
            </h2>
            <p class="comn-para">It's important to ensure that when choosing a probiotic for Vaginal health you select one that only includes strains of probiotic which are proven scientifically to aid in this area. We have listed below the main strains that have actual studies behind them,</p>

            <p class="comn-para">A probiotic strain that has been shown to prevent the colonisation of harmful bacteria in the vaginal microbiota is <mark>Lactobacillus reuteri</mark>. Studies have demonstrated that women with bacterial vaginosis who took L. reuteri orally had a higher cure rate compared to those who took a placebo. Furthermore, it has also been shown to help reduce the recurrence of vaginal infections. </p>

            <p class="comn-para"> A probiotic strain that is commonly found in the vaginal microbiota is <mark>Lactobacillus acidophillus</mark>. It is known to produce lactic acid, which helps to maintain a healthy pH in the vaginal environment. </p>

            <p class="comn-para"><mark>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</mark> has been found to be effective in the prevention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Studies have shown that L. rhamnosus can help restore the balance of the vaginal microbiota and reduce the recurrence of infections. It has also been suggested to be effective in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections.</p>

            <p class="comn-para"><mark>Fructo-oligosaccarides</mark> - are a type of prebiotic that can help stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as lactobacilli, in the vaginal microbiota. Studies have shown that the use of fructo-oligosaccharides in combination with probiotics can be effective in the prevention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.</p>

            <p class="comn-para"><mark>Lactobacillus plantarum</mark> is a probiotic strain that has been shown to have antimicrobial properties. It has been suggested to be effective in the prevention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis and to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections.</p>

            <p class="comn-para"><mark>Cranberry Extract</mark> - commonly used to support urinary tract health. It may help prevent and treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) by inhibiting bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract.</p>

                    <p class="comn-para">There’s one very important thing to keep in mind. Those high CFU numbers and special strains aren’t any good to you if they haven’t survived the passage to your gut! Research has shown that in order for probiotics to be of any benefit, they must first survive the journey through the acidic environment of your gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                    
                    <p class="comn-para">Delayed release capsules are made of a synthetic material that can tolerate the harsh environment of your stomach, so it will survive the passage through to your intestines, making them a must have when choosing probiotics</p>

                <strong>
                    Rock & Roses is the only brand on the market that includes prebiotics with their probiotic strains along with a Delayed Release formula. Its 1 a day capsule is the optimal way to supplement and in our opinion nothing else really comes close for female health than this supplement.

            <p class="comn-para">
                Rock & Roses is a small-sized company right now. Compared to other household name brands, they don’t
                have a massive inventory of Probiotics for Her Delayed Release.
            </p>
            <p class="comn-para">
                In other words, with higher demand than the supply, their inventory sells out fast.
            </p>
            <p class="comn-para">The good news is:</p>
            <p class="comn-para">

            </p>
