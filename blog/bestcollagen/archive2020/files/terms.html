						provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Arbitration
						Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Arbitration Agreement
						will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or
						requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement. This Arbitration
